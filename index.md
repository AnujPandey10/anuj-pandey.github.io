I work at the intersection of **Data Science, AI, and Pharmaceutical Manufacturing**.

My focus is on applying **statistics, machine learning, and process understanding** to real-world bioprocess and insulin manufacturing problems.

This site is where I share:
- Applied projects from industry
- Technical notes and learnings
- Practical perspectives on AI in regulated environments
